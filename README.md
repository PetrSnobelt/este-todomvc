> The most cute web app boilerplate, with almost zero bus factor. Forget about over abstracted frameworks, use sheer libraries and leverage standards.

## Features

- Written in [BabelScript](https://babeljs.io/). Are you kidding me? No, the babeljs is the best JavaScript transpiler. It handles future JavaScripts with React JSX syntax spiced by TypeScript type annotations.
- React, Flux, react-router, immutable.js, and more awesomeness.
- Isomorphic architecture with state-less stores, server rendering, and routing inside expressjs.
- The state of art performance thank to immutable.js and PureRendererMixin combo.
- Well tuned dev stack based on gulp and webpack configured both for dev and production.
- Vanilla Flux, remember what I told you about frameworks?
- Isomorphic 404 and 500 pages.

## Install

```
  git clone https://github.com/steida/este-todomvc.git
  npm i
```

## Run

- `gulp`              - start development
- `gulp -p`           - build and run app in production mode
- `gulp build -p`     - just build app for production

## Todo

- jest, eslint, flowlang
- localization with http://formatjs.io
- sync app state in localstorage across tabs, that's how every web app should work
- app errors handling
- async actions
